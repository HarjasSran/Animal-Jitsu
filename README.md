# FinalSummativeICS4U
This project was a final project for my Grade 12 Programming class
#ANIMAL JITSU
The name of this game is Animal Jitsu and it uses Java and OOP to make a replica game.
# About of the game
The player can select a character and then a name for their character. After pressing the start button with their mouse, the player then enter the main playing screen.
On the main game screen, the player is met by an AI named Sensei Peng who is a Penguin. The player gets a hand of 5 cards of which they will click to choose the specific card to play. Each card has an element and a numerical value assigned to it. Water distinguishes Fire, Fire melts Ice, and Ice freezes Water. After the player draws a card from their hand of 5, they will gain another card to fill the empty spot of the now player card. After this, the AI will pick their card to play against yours. If the round comes to a tie, whichever hard has the highest numerical value would win. This gameplay will continue until the player has won 3 times with one singular element or atleast once with all elements, then they will be ranked up to a higher level and Bow colour(which is similiar to belts in martial arts). If the AI however wins 3 times with one element or once with each element, then the player would go down a rank and bow level.
